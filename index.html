    <subtitle>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</subtitle>
    <p>Hello! I'm Asad, a dedicated software developer at iEnergizer. My expertise lies in creating efficient and scalable software solutions that meet the diverse needs of our clients.</p>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I have a strong background in software development with a passion for continuous learning and improvement. At iEnergizer, I collaborate with a talented team to deliver high-quality software products.</p>
    <h3>Key Attributes of a Quality Website</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lightweight and fast-loading.</li>
      <li>Responsive design that fits all screen sizes.</li>
      <li>Consistent appearance across all browsers.</li>
      <li>Accessibility for all users.</li>
      <li>Clear and legible content that effectively communicates the message.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Best Practices in Web Development</h3>
    <p>As a professional developer, I adhere to the following best practices to ensure optimal performance and user experience:</p>
    <h4>Utilize Efficient Font Stacks</h4>
    <p>Using system fonts instead of remote fonts can significantly reduce load times and improve performance.</p>
    <h4>Implement HTTPS</h4>
    <p>Securing websites with HTTPS is essential for data integrity and user trust. Additionally, HTTPS improves search engine rankings and is required for HTTP/2 support.</p>
    <h4>Enable Compression</h4>
    <p>Compressing website content with gzip or other methods reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up page load times.</p>
    <h4>Leverage Caching</h4>
    <p>Implementing caching mechanisms ensures that repeat visitors experience faster load times by reusing previously downloaded resources.</p>
    <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
    <p>I believe in the continuous improvement of my skills and the projects I work on. If you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out or contribute via my <a href="https://github.com/asadkhan7865571/asadwebsite" title="GitHub Repository">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
